# Hybrid-Approach-for-IDS
In the recent research, Intrusion Detection system in Machine Learning has given good detection and high accuracy on novel attacks.
The major purpose of this study is implementing a method that combines Random-Forest classification technique and K-Means clustering Algorithms. 
In misuse-detection, random-forest algorithm will build a pattern of intrusion over a training data. And in anomaly-detection, intrusions will be identified by the outlierdetection mechanism. 
This hybrid-detection system will combine the advantage of anomaly and mis-use detection and improves the performance of detection. 
This research work mainly focused on evaluating the performance of hybrid approaches namely Gaussian Mixture clustering with Random Forest Classifiers and K-Means clustering with Random Forest Classifiers in-order to detect intrusion. 
These algorithms were evaluated for the four categories of attacks based on accuracy, false-alarm-rate, and detection-rate.
